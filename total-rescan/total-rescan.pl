#.########################################################################,
 # THIS SCRIPT *MUST* RUN AS ROOT, DUE TO chroot! IT CANNOT RUN WITHOUT!  #
 # (will give an error like "- Chroot failed! (Operation not permitted)") #
#`#######################################################################Â´

#
# info:
#  this is a pure perlscript, and also not using any modules.
#  it rescans a dir and all subdirs that contain a .sfv (or .zip, see $zipscan)
#  this is probably only useful if you've had fsck delete some files or if 
#  you've moved files to the site without using the ftpd, or before
#  zipscript was installed. it runs a given rescan binary from chroot
#  inside any dirs that have a .sfv/zip-file. :-) (see $zipscan)
#  it will print one line for each 'rescan', and it'll be "+ PASSED:" or
#  "- FAILED:", based on the returnvalue of rescan binary. all output
#  from the rescan binary is supressed. :)
#
#  as of 1.4 it also supports resorting audiolinks. this feature does the same
#  as rescan, minus the rescanning part. this requires pzs-ng v1.0.1b or equivilant.
#  it goes over all dirs, finds those with a .mp3, and sorts them into the pzs-ng-defined
#  sort dirs. :) for sorting, see $onlysort. (rescan sorts per default)
#
# config/setup:
#  requires NO config or setup, unless glroot/bin/rescan isn't your rescan binary.
#  if so, change '$rescan'-variable below. the only other things you need to take
#  care of is commandline. you run the script with:
#   ./total-rescan.pl PATH-I-WANT-TO-RESCAN GLFTPD-ROOT-DIRECTORY
#  GLFTPD-ROOT-DIRECTORY is optional, defaults to /glftpd (should be ok for most people).
#  PATH-I-WANT-TO-RESCAN is RELATIVE to GLFTPD-ROOT-DIRECTORY, so if you do this:
#  ./total-rescan.pl site/games
#  it will rescan /glftpd/site/games/, and not ./site/games/.
#  morale is: remember to include site/-prefix, if you need it. :-) (thanks _-] :)
#  
# history:
#  version 1 is a full rewrite of total-rescan 0.x,
#  so i thought giving it its own version number was
#  the least i could do ;) 
#  
# changelog:
#  from 1.4
#  * now actually resorts if onlysort = 1 (problem with environment-variables made audiosort misbehave)
#  ! outputs statistics on how many dirs were resorted, and on each dir sorted.
#  ! retabbed the whole script to proper retab.
#  + added vim modeline <3
#  + $defaultroot variable can now be used to set the default glroot if none is specified on the cmdline.
#    (default is /glftpd)
#  ! made output-matching from rescan a bit more friendly.
#  + added $skipmatch variable, dirs are checked against this before recursed into and possibly rescanned. ;-)
#  * now skipping recursion into symlinks.
#
#  from 1.3
#  ! now chmods the rmscript to 755.
#  + $printeach setting, can be used to disable PASSED: and FAILED: for each rescan. (E.g. for big archives)
#  ! caching of dirs and such, to fix a potential abuse of memory ;-) (thanks to iRacer for reporting)
#     ^--- rewritten.
#  * getscandirs() now skip symlinks
#  + support for *only* sorting audioreleases, not rescanning. (needs pzs-ng v1.0.1 or equivilant)
#  * if $rmscript was '', it would produce warnings / errors.
#  + support for zip-rescanning too ;) (see $zipscan, default on)
#  + preserves mtime/atime of the dir being rescanned (thanks iNDi).
#    (see $preservestamp) this will (supposedly) make site new work ok. ;)
#  ! now you can set $stampfromfile to use first .sfv/.zip in the dir for the mtime/atime,
#    instead of the dir itself. :) (only if preservestmap)
#  * getscandirs wasn't closing the dirhandle if there were no zips/sfvs in a dir.
#  ! "path" is now "pattern"; glob-matched pattern. :)
#  * variablenames overlapping and output and such.
#  * slight syntax error.
#  ! lists my real email in here now. =P
#  * $rescan wasn't being used, at all. :)
#
#  from 1.2
#  * rmlog.sh was accidentally overwritten at end of script, fixed. 
#  ! didn't work with perl 5.005, switched to -w and two-argument open()
#
#  from 1.1
#  + rmlog.sh-generate feature. :-) (script to remove all failed dirs)
#  * rmlog.sh generated in / now. :)
#  * rmlog.sh now generates newlines, and fixed a broken conditional :)
#  * total-rescan actually (perhaps) works. (note to self: rescan always returns 0, no matter what)
#  ! rmlog.sh is cleaned out at start of run, and prints two lines. ;)
#
#  from 1.0
#   ! output messages
#   * not working due to no chdir to / after chroot
#   * not working due to a misnamed sub (recandirs, not rescandirs)
#   - check for absolute path
#
#  from 0.x
#   ! full rewrite
#
# key   description
#  +    added
#  -    removed
#  *    bugfix
#  !    change
# (please, report bugs and / or send feature requests to daxxar@daxxar.com)
